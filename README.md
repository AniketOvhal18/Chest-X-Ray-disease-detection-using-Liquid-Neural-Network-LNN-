# Chest-X-Ray-disease-detection-using-Liquid-Neural-Network-LNN-
This project is a Flask-based web application that uses Liquid Neural Networks (LNNs) to automatically detect chest abnormalities from X-ray images. The application is designed to handle bulk uploads (1000+ images at once) and outputs a detailed Excel sheet with ranked predictions based on model confidence.
